## AI Threat Detection Tool

### Overview
This Python-based application provides real-time monitoring of system processes and employs a neural network model to identify potential threats. 
By analyzing key process metrics like CPU and memory usage, I/O operations, and more, the system effectively flags suspicious activities. 
This tool is invaluable for security professionals and system administrators seeking to safeguard their systems by proactively detecting and responding to abnormal process behaviors.

### Key Features
* **Real-Time Process Monitoring:** Continuously tracks all active system processes.
* **Threat Detection:** Leverages a neural network model to classify processes as benign or malicious.
* **Data Collection:** Gathers non-threat process data and generates synthetic threat data for model training.
* **Model Training:** Trains a neural network model using collected data and assesses its performance.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Offers an intuitive Tkinter-based interface for easy operation.
* **Threat Logging:** Automatically records detected threats in a CSV file for subsequent analysis.
